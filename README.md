# A-star-algorithm-game

Description:
A game in which agents pursue a player in a map with obstacles using
the A* star algorithm to calculate the shortest path to the player.
The goal of the game is to escape the enemies as long as possible while 
you capture as many gems as you can. Big score bonuses for capturing gems.

Note:
This project is meant to be a resource for the interested in making a game
in Java and/or trying to learn how to implement the A* algorithm.
I hope you find my implementation of the algorithm in this little game
helpful to your learning!
