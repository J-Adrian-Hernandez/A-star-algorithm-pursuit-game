# A-star-algorithm-pursuit-game

Description:
A game in which agents pursue a player in a map with obstacles using
the A* star algorithm to calculate the shortest path to the player.
The goal of the game is to escape the enemies as long as possible.

Note:
This project is meant to be a resource for the interested in making a game
in Java and/or trying to learn how to implement the A* algorithm.
I hope you find my implementation of the algorithm in this little game
helpful to your learning!
